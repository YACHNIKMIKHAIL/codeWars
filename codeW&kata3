You and a group of friends are earning some extra money in the school holidays by re-painting the numbers on people's letterboxes for a small fee.

Since there are 10 of you in the group each person just concentrates on painting one digit! For example, somebody will paint only the 1's, somebody else will paint only the 2's and so on...

But at the end of the day you realise not everybody did the same amount of work.

To avoid any fights you need to distribute the money fairly. That's where this Kata comes in.

Kata Task
Given the start and end letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted.

Example
For start = 125, and end = 132

The letterboxes are

125 = 1, 2, 5
126 = 1, 2, 6
127 = 1, 2, 7
128 = 1, 2, 8
129 = 1, 2, 9
130 = 1, 3, 0
131 = 1, 3, 1
132 = 1, 3, 2


var paintLetterboxes = function(start, end) {
   let res = [],
        res2 = [];
    while (start <= end) {
        res = res.concat(String(start).split(''))
        start++
    }
    for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        res2.push(res.filter(x => x == i).length)
    }
    return res2
  return [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
}






A Madhav array has the following property:

a[0] = a[1] + a[2] = a[3] + a[4] + a[5] = a[6] + a[7] + a[8] + a[9] = ...

Complete the function/method that returns true if the given array is a Madhav array, otherwise it returns false.

Edge cases: An array of length 0 or 1 should not be considered a Madhav array as there is nothing to compare.



function isMadhavArray(a) {
    if (a.length < 2 || 0.5 * (Math.sqrt(8 * a.length + 1) - 1) < 0 || Math.abs((0.5 * (Math.sqrt(8 * a.length + 1) - 1)) % 1) > 1e-12) return false;
    let v = a[0];
    for (let i = 1, s = 2; i + s <= a.length; i += s, s++) if (a.slice(i, i + s).reduce((s, n) => s + n, 0) !== v) return false;
  return true
 }
