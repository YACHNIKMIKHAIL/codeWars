All Star Code Challenge #22

Create a function that takes an integer argument of seconds and converts the value into a string describing how many hours and minutes comprise that many seconds.

Any remaining seconds left over are ignored.

Note:
The string output needs to be in the specific form - "X hour(s) and X minute(s)"


function toTime(seconds) {
  const hours = Math.floor(seconds / 3600);
  const minutes = Math.floor(seconds % 3600 / 60);
  return `${hours} hour(s) and ${minutes} minute(s)`
}



You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. 
The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. 
Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

function findOutlier(integers){
 const arr=integers.reduce((a,c)=>(a[Math.abs(c)%2+2]+=1,a[Math.abs(c)%2]=c,a),[0,0,0,0]);     
  return arr[2] > arr[3] ? arr[1] : arr[0]; 
}



Create a class Ball. Ball objects should accept one argument for "ball type" when instantiated.

If no arguments are given, ball objects should instantiate with a "ball type" of "regular."

var Ball = function(ballType) {
  
    ballType === undefined ? this.ballType = 'regular' : this.ballType = 'super'
};



Complete the function that calculates the area of the red square, when the length of the circular arc A is given as the input. Return the result rounded to two decimals.

Graph



function squareArea(A){
  var circum = 4 * A;
    var radius = circum / (2 * Math.PI);
    var area = Math.pow(radius, 2);
    return Math.round(area*100)/100
}
